Chapter 2 : 

        Variables Decaration:

                    Variable basic types like int, double, num, bool etc
                    Diff between 'var' and 'dynamic' (dynamic can update datatype as we assign a new value, but var save datatype only once in start)
                    const (if we assigned any value to a const variable we cant change it)
        
        Strigns and Strign Interpolation:
              
                    In this section i saw strings can be written in both (single and double qoutes qoutes  ), combine, and multi line.
                    for a paragraph we use '"""' mean triple qoutes.

        Functions:
                   
                    simple Functions
                    Functions with optional  parameters (unNamed and named), duplicate function
                    ....
